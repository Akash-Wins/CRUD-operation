## DISCRIPTION OF PACKAGE

* #### Express
   Express is a node js web application framework that provides broad features for building web and mobile applications. It is used to build a       single page, multipage, and hybrid web application.

* #### Mongoose 
   Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

* #### dotenv 
   The dotenv package is a great way to keep passwords, API keys, and other sensitive data out of your code. It allows you to create environment variables in a . env file instead of putting them in your code.

* #### JOI 
   Joi module is a popular module for data validation. This module validates the data based on schemas. There are various functions like optional(), required(), min(), max(), etc which make it easy to use and a user-friendly module for validating the data.

* #### Bcrypt
   bcrypt is an npm module that simplifies password salting and hashing.

* #### Jwt 
   JWTs are mainly used for authentication. After a user signs in to an application, the application then assigns JWT to that user. Subsequent requests by the user will include the assigned JWT. This token tells the server what routes, services, and resources the user is allowed to access.

* #### Nodemon 
   Nodemon is a popular tool that is used for the development of applications based on node. js. It simply restarts the node application whenever it observes the changes in the file present in the working directory of your project.
